Command-Line Arguments in C: argc and argv
When writing C programs, it's common to encounter situations where you need to provide input or parameters to the program when executing it. Command-line arguments offer a way to pass such information to a C program during runtime. In C, the argc and argv parameters in the main() function are used to handle command-line arguments. This guide will provide an overview of argc and argv and explain how to use them effectively.

argc (Argument Count)
argc represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program. It is an integer value that indicates the total count of arguments, including the program name itself.

argv (Argument Vector)
argv is an array of strings where each element represents a command-line argument. It is defined as char *argv[] and contains argc number of elements. The first element, argv[0], traditionally holds the name of the program itself, while subsequent elements hold the other command-line arguments.
